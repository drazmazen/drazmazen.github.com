The first time I typed in [POKE 53281](http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/POKE) to change the background color on my Commodore 64 I was hooked on coding. I was 10 years old and it was fun and magical. Still is. Nowadays, my work is mostly about C# .NET, but I've also been known to dabble in BASIC, c, c++, Java, php, JavaScript, python and anything else I can get my hands on.
